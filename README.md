# Shorcut URL

This is a simple URL shortener application built with Next.js and React Server Components, using the ui.shadcn component library. The application allows users to input a long URL and receive a shortened URL that can be used to access the original long URL. The mapping between long URLs and short URLs is managed using Vercel KV, a Redis database provided by Vercel.
